## Updates on guidelines

* Received lots of feedback, will be incorporating everything over the course of the next weeks
* Discussed the usage of external links into official policies and guidelines.
  * Not prohibited but usually recommend not to since sites may change and content may no longer be available.
  * Some scientific process to avoid problems is to link to the external resource but include the date at which it was accessed.
  * Also need to have the resources in both official languages and sometimes it's just not possible on external resources.
* Points mentioned:
  * Needs more work on the Open Standards requirements and guidelines but will not be included in this round of consultations specifically.
* Might need another meeting on Friday to continue
