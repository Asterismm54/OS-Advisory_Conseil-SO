## Roadmap

* The roadmap covers everything, aligns with milestones but not timelines for the open source policy
  * Guillaume is producing an Open Source Policy, there may be a first draft by the end of the week which will include using, contributing and publishing open source. It will be a directive, not a standard.


## Tasks

* Review requirements (using, contributing and publishing) on [Open First Directive](https://github.com/canada-ca/open-source-logiciel-libre)
* Use cases and guidance around it
  * Create scenarios will identify risk, licenses etc., where your questions will be answered
  * If a task can't be completed in 2 weeks, we should break it up into a few deliverables

## Questions

  * Yes, there is the AI directive on Automated Decision Making. It will be used as a template for ours
