## Notes

* For the review of technology stacks or reference architecture:
  * Not everyone has the right background / experience to review assessments for each technology
  * Might need to extend assessment to other groups in the GC or in the private sector that have previous experience on these.
* Specifically around **Drupal 8 WXT distribution**:
  * Barry Kong: might be able to provide contacts like Ross Thompson
  * Marc: Oproma team has experience with web content migrations, will have a look
* Ex: PCO presentation switch from proprietary DB to PostgreSQL
  * GC or private sector to provide experience.
  * Leverage other communities:
    * OSS on GCconnex, GCcollab
    * Enterprise architecture groups.
* For the web-based IM project: need is more generic and doesn't require expertise in IM specifically
  * Mention of Jabber: what's the status of the protocol vs product?
  * Mention of Zulip: https://zulipchat.com/
  * StatCan: live chat on website - LiveZilla (plugin/proprietary)
  * A dimension that should be assessed also is: Security, Information Management, Intended User Base, User Experience
* Additional technologies and reference architectures to look into:
  * Cloud:
    * Kubernetes and containers
    * Reference architecture & tech review

    * Reference architecture and technical review
    * Cloud-based
    * On-premise
  * Business Process Management:

  * Search:

    * Marc: team has a lot of experience in the domain, both OSS/COTS
  * VCS vs Application life cycle management:
  * IDE, Code scanning for security and compliance, CI/CD tools
* Roundtable:
  * Jim: Artifactory X-ray does security and compliance scanning
  * Nick: Java support vs OpenJDK - who is dealing with this change in direction: OSAB may need to provide a recommendation forward.
