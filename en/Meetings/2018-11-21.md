Open government
need private sector involvement
how do we engage companies in the Opne Gov?
How do we connect with OSS?
How do we create the community?

Chance to effect the movement
- Include the private sector

Open Data - Canada is num. 1

Inclusion of provinces and municipalities are working with us
- Not a silo initiative

Summit: up to 1500 participants

Shaw Center May 29-31, 2019

Possibility to self-create a side event
- Could be show-cased on the website - Opportunity
- Agenda is self governed: need link to share
  - Opportunity to have hard discussions on the stage

Key objective:
- Domestic engagement
- Peer learning
- Global influence

Summit Themes and Content
- Bold are items that might be of interest to OSS community

Action item:

To have access to the presentation proposal: Twitter link will be broadcasting

Survey is up, need to have link:


One of the topics that is currently hard to do: services to citizens (how does open data help provide better services to citizens)

Caveat: not the place for a vendor pitch - People will throw shoes at you
- Why Open or why not.

Tech for good. Good outcome to have

Twitter account is the best place to receive updates and mailing list provides monthly summaries.

Departments and private companies can provide

Tech tradeshow: exposure with partiicipants from around the world.
- Location would be in the windowed area.

DPI could provide some additional input.

Monday-Tuesday are not 100% organized by GC
Wednesday-Thursday main event for Open Data

## Open Decision Framework

Having an open decision Framework helped to support the organisation's growth

Disconnection between employee and higher management, open decision Framework helps bridge that disconnect. Cultural challenges, multiple ways of communicating.

Bigger decisions went better than some smaller ones that caused uprest amongst the employees.

Lead to Open Decision Framework

Step-by-step wasn't so much valuable but people needs to know Why they are doing something. When open to interpretation, people sometimes feel insecure.

Question: how can we apply this to gouvernement?

Discussing in the open can be more productive since it captures many perspectives.

Activate ambassadors, equip community to promote project.

Need to enhance governance around the Open Government with Drupal, CKAN, etc.
- What can we do to have contributors from other governments.
