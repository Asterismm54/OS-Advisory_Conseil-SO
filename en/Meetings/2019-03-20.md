## 2. OSS Best practices and Lessons learned
[To view this presentation, please consult our Issues page](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/issues/120)
Questions
* When you mentioned that the department of defence said that it was ok using Open Source Software, were there any concerns about the legal implications?
  * They put in place the right processes to address questions by creating an FAQ. There was also a collaborative effort from lawyers to respond to any concerns. 
* Is purchasing a subscription the only alternative to purchasing a perpetual licence?
  * Purchasing a subscription is the most viable way in the context of the US government 
* Does that imply that the subscription/service comes only from the company that released the software?
  * A subscription model kind of implies vendor lock-in, which is one of the risks of proprietary software that open source is supposed to address
* Is there anything stopping someone from switching from RedHat to CentOS? 
* Do you think government has any unique opportunities for engaging and supporting open source? If so, what are they? Have you seen any examples that we should see?
  * Release often 
  * Contribute back and engage in the open source community you are working with
  * Start small, socialize it in your organization 
  * Find test beds
  * Forking projects= risk 
  * GoC could contribute back and participate in many roles in the linux foundation - in fact, SELinux was a heavy US government contributor.
  * We should consider defining open source community (where software technology is focus, purpose, objectives) versus "open community innovation practices" that would ideally be formed within the GoC and handle how collaboration is done across departments using OSS communitiesâ€™ software
  * We should look into setting up a CCLA (corporate committer license agreement) for the GoC for contributing back to the open source communities which you engage with

## 3. Update on Guidelines
* We are requesting you to provide feedback on the following guides:
  * [Guide for Using Open Source Software](https://github.com/canada-ca/open-source-logiciel-libre/blob/master/en/guides/using-open-source-software.md)
  * [Guide for Contributing to Open Source Software](https://github.com/canada-ca/open-source-logiciel-libre/blob/master/en/guides/contributing-to-open-source-software.md)
  * [Guide for Publishing Open Source Code](https://github.com/canada-ca/open-source-logiciel-libre/blob/master/en/guides/publishing-open-source-code.md)
* We are trying to build off what we built in Appendix C on the Directive on the Management of IT
* Feedback is due by end of day March 27th 

Questions/comments
* In regards to contributing to an open source project with a Government of Canada email, how will we manage this?
* Values and Ethics could help with this 
* Align with social media 
* Science-based Departments have scientific integrity policies that apply to the work product of their scientists. Most of the language is oriented primarily toward patent and commercialization, but the policy is oriented specifically toward intellectual property
* Some employers are changing their HR policies to contribute to OSS
