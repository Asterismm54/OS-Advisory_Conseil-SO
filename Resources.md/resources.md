1. [InnerSource](https://paypal.github.io/InnerSourceCommons/)
* Is the concept of Open Source but within a particular department, agency, or a group of similar agencies.  Denis Skinner mentioned
     there is difficulties in sharing and collaborating on internal
     projects.  
* Just last week at GitHub Constellation in London, we had [Lloyd's bank] (https://www.computerworlduk.com/devops/lloyds-software-lead-james-mcleod-on-innersourcing-bank-3673828/) talk about their InnerSource journey that has led to building a community of collaboration internally within the bank.

2. [CapitalOne's Dev Exchange] (https://medium.com/capital-one-developers/open-source-in-a-regulated-environment-dc4b4d9af3f8)
* CapitalOne is a great example of a company who has successfully utilized GitHub for both internal development and external (open) development.

3.  [How Github uses GitHub] (https://resources.github.com/webcasts/GitHub-writing-documentation-for-your-projects/) 
* I believe you were interested in this.  Late last year, we did a full series of [webcasts](https://resources.github.com/webcasts/) on this topic. On our [resources] (https://resources.github.com/) page, you find find additional white papers, and videos. 
     
 
4. Finally, Marc asked about secure development.  From the [question] (https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/blob/master/Meetings/2018-03-15.mdection) "Concerning Github, what secuirty measures are in place to provent mistakes? Two controls: no one can delete and there is a backup in cloud. Many controls like fork and branch to review the code before publishing it."
