### Questions
* How are you collaborating with other departments?
  * Using Gitlab but it is challenging. 
* Do you look at open standards? What about sharing closed software?
  * Interopability, we need to pick the right software with the support of the community. Need maintenance and support standards. 
  * We have a different approach then other countries when it comes to sharing closed software. It's harder for larger vendor community
* Concerning Github, what security measures are in place to prevent mistakes?
  * Two controls: no one can delete and there is a backup in cloud. 
  * Many controls like fork and branch to review the code before publishing it.
* License workshop April 3, 2018.
* Considerations for solving problems   
  * Strength of community   
  * Shouldn't pick standards to early, we need flexibility to figure out which standard would work best
  * Legal working group
* How is open source affecting experienced employees compared to new grads?
  * The experienced employees find this change difficult. It is transforming their day-to-day work.
