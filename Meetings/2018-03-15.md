## Materials 
### A Case For Open Source Software At the PSC 
#### Presentation By The Public Service Commision of Canada Information Technology Services Directorate
##### March, 2018 

### Open Source Software at the PSC
* Leapfrog innovative business opporunity; and 
* In line with the Public Service Commission's strategic decision to double down on Open Source Software (OSS).

### Business Problem 

### Current PSC Context 
* Legacy development environments and systems operate in silos and are rarely enterprise centric.
* Strong dependencies between development and middleware teams. 
* Temporary transition environments costs prohibitive. Duplication of license costs. 
* Existing mix of proprietary and open source solutions and environments. 
* OSS has been used at the PSC in production since its first innovative web applications were deployed in the year 2000.

## GC Context 
* Digital 7: commitment to work together, exhcange and invest to promote digital 
* GC Digital Principles (Draft)
* Proprietary software is no guarantee of success

«... Brison has argued the Phoenix crisis has forced the government to re-think how it manages, builds and buys technology.

...member countries signed the Digital 7 charter, which calls for commitments to **open standards, open source**...»

## OSS is Already Here 

## Cross-Jurisdiction and International Collarboration 
* The PSC is updating it's Open government Implementation Plan to include publishing open source software. 
* GC could support this collaboration by establishing certified/ standard products, tools, librariers, etc. 

## Considerations 

**Adoption**
* Community activity and maturity 
* Google Trends of candidate product and competing solutions 
* Social media activity 
* Popularity on code repositories e.g. github

**HR**
* Job offers related to the product
* Training costs (readily available on MOOCs)
* Mentions in job profiles 

**Digital Government**
* Interoperability
* Product features and innovation

**Maintainability**
* Availability on cloud 
* Ecosystem/Platforrm availability 
* Support network discussion activity e.g.  Stackoverflow 
* Status of open tickets
* Vulnerability reports of stable versions
* Documentation 
* Time to fix vulnerabilities 

**Legal**
* Open license model
* Enterprise level support (for those who want/need it)
* Standards compliance e.g. WCAG 2.0

## Mitigating Risks 

**Minimizing Support Risk**

The open source support community has a collaboration culture e.g. stackoverflow. Opportunities to co-fund development with other departments, levels of governments and countries. 

**Safety Net**

Leading Open Source solutions have enterprise level support services from the lead development organization or from a wide range of consulting firms. 

**Security**

* Considerations for open souurce software are similar as for proprietary software. 
* Source code security audit possible and recommended. 
* Bug bounty could be explored. 
* GC wide support contracts for agreed upon standards (e.g. France). 
* network security applicances already use OSS. 

**Minimizing Lock-In risks**

* Open-source solutions are a crucial step in ensuring mobility across cloud providers e.g moving workload to/from Google, AWS, Microsoft Azure etc. 

## Values and Ethics

**Respect for Democracy**

Open Source is often developed and adopted folllowing democratic objectives. 

**Respect for People**

Diversity of contributions fromm a wide variety of backgrounds is a reality in the open-source field and the results. 

**Integrity**

There are no secret elements in the tools we use to deliver value to citizen e.g adoption of AI in the delivery of services. 

**Stewardship**

Investment in sustainable, open, affordable solutions is a cornerstone of good stewardship. 

**Excellence**

Now that open source solutions have had time to mature and meet their business objectives, they must be given equal consideration.

## Outcomes

**Recruitment**

Testomonals from students indicate that they are drawn to jobs which clearly identify the use of OSS. 

**Job Satisfaction**

More learning opportunities for employees supporting OSS solutions. 
Positive feeling of contributing to something bigger than even their organizations. 

**Code quality**

Coding in the open shines light on the work, forcing a higher standard. 

**Trust in Government**

Open government objectives met by the use of open code. 

**Economic Growth**

Any Canadian business can become a GC supplier, thus eliminating major barriers of entry for start-ups and SMEs. 
Anyone can reuse GC OSS, thus driving innovation and economic opporunities. 

**Innovation**

Allows for increase agility and reuse in the implementation of technical solutions. 

## Next Steps

Determine IP/ associated GC license for published code (e.g. MIT, Apache 2.0)
Contribute back to the open source projects. 

## Philosophy 

**"Using, contributing and publishing open code is the foundation for the democratization of information technology in the public service."**

## Annex A- Case Study Example PSRS
* In 2001, Public Service Recruitment System (PSRS) was implemented with TOP Web, an early Java web framework that enforced MVC principles for web applications. 
* TOP Web source code was provided by The Object People to the PSC. 
* The Object People consultants left the PSC after the initial implementation of the system (Q4 2001).
* In-house PSC developers maintained and enhanced the framework **because** the full source code was made available as a requirement. 
* PSRS could not have evolved like it did without TOP Web being open source. Still in production today servicing hundreds of thousands of active users. 

## Annex B- Case Study Example Databses
* PSC is seeking to perform its enclave move as part of the Work Load Migration with Shared Services Canada. To do so, there is a requirement to move applications, group by group, from one server environment to an other. As such, database systems will exist in parallel, potentially for years. 
* Proprietary (clsoed source) license costs would have been unaffordable. Challenges in licensing of the RDBMS on shared infastructure and with other departments. 
* Summer students were able to mograte proprietary RDBMS Java applications that leverage open source software frameworks(e.g. Struts/Spring) using **PostgreSQL.** Other production ready alternatives with enterprise support exist.
