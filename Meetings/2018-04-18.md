## 2. Open Source Day
* To view the presentation please visit the [Open Source Advisory Board Slidewiki website](http://slidewiki.aksw.org/deck/30-1/slide/283-2/283-2:7/view)
* Target mid-June but we are working on it. 
* Overview of current state and project
* Melaine Robert: There is an Open government week happening across Canada through the Open Government Portal from May 7-11, 2018. There is the possibility to have an open source event during this week. 

## 3. Agile Procurement Presentation
* Procurement as a process designed for risk minimazation. 
* Focused on outcomes, no using RFPs
* Currently there is a draft definition but we need to figure out what are missing in agile procurement. 
* Challenges: Licensing. How do we choose the right licence? 

## Discussion
* Why did the accessibility procurement not work out?
* What do we mean by accessibility?
  * 14% of Canadians have a disability, i.e. physical, cognition. 
* Is open source a best fit for procurement?
  * Documents need to be accessible. Accessible by default. 
* There needs to be a clear definition on what we define Open Source in agile procurement
* Will we get vendors from the non-open source for this model?
* Accessibility: 
  * Clarify with authors. 
  * Nuanced environment:  can never be 100% accessible, can't be 100% secure either. Having a description of a picture would not be considered accessible. 
  * Have we incorrectly defined the problem?
* Accessibility by design and procurement is important 
* Tools working group: PDFS, open source standards.
* Challenge in open government groups: need for open source documents, procurement and accessibility 
* Vendors appreciate short cycle of agile procurement.
* Are we overly tilting the scales?
* Why is everything not open by default?
* Open Source tools can be used to support improvement of accessibility-AX? PAlly?- Mike gifford to confirm 
* How do you see this getting scaled?
  * Get business owners engaged. Procurement allows for future phases of the projects, this is where you get the scale.
* Procurement has to be figured out I.e. proof of concept of MVP. Vendors need to know that they can move forward 
* GC DEVexchange- fork of BC dev exchange: value 75,000 agile procurement contracts. 
* Rodney: get excutives to come for Open Source Day about BC DEV exchange. Public sector presenter
* Vendors to innovate: accessibility 

## 4. Github Best Practices Presentation 

Please visit [Enabling Open Source](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/issues/14)

* Why it matters: 
  * Intersource commons: what is possible
* BC DEVExchange
  * It is tapping into the community. Find work what is valued to you and you can go into the projects and contribute your work. 
* Vendors: Can choose multiple vendors to solve a problem but this might be expensive. The challenge is that this process is used for small applications owned by the government of Canada.
* Interoperability between different ministries: traffic cameras on the highway but forestry dept. wanted to use their code for it to track forest fires 
* co.gov: experimentation is being done with open resource exchange
* Capital One: example of how we connect to a community and contribute to it. 
* RBC Example: Open source and inner source is and was key for this project 
* Gitlab: similar Open Source product to Github
  * The Drupal community is moving stuff to gitlab for better collaboration. 
  * Github has two version: The public version and the enterprise
  * Gitlab is a good option for the Government
  * Can you run your own nob in the enterprise version? I.e. search blockchain on github enterprise, see everything that the different government departments are doing but public can't see it
* Can you transfer github enterprise to public? yes. 
* Capital one: innersource github enterprise.
* Do you support classification of code? Need standards for code.
* Why aren't we sharing code more?
* Can work with DMZ or Carleton to get students working
* Open source transparency: New York Times. Five Thirty Eight
* Github does change terms of reference for government 

## 5. Roundtable 

## Action Items
* Establish a lead for the Rules and People working groups
* Melaine Robert: send email to Ashley for open government week.
