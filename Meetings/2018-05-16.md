## 1. Update: Working Group Rules 

To view the presentation, please view the [Update Working Group Rules Slidewiki site](http://slidewiki.aksw.org/deck/38-1)
1.	Update: Working Group Rules
* There is some overlap with the Open First Whitepaper, we need to look at what other topics are being discussed so that we are not having the same discussion 
  * Reuse what is already out there
•	Deliverables
  1. Draft standard around open source for GC
  2. Finishing up the Whitepaper
  3. Define legal components/dependencies for each of the five major elements. Legal impacts to government like policy, procurement etc. This will feed into the business case

## 2. Update: Working Group Tools
To view this update, please view the [Working Group Tools github page](https://github.com/canada-ca/OS-Advisory_Conseil-SO/blob/master/Working_Group_Tools/Tools.md)
* Have an open source platform that went through the security and showed evidence, that is fully reusable for the departments. Shared which ones have security accreditation 
* Show vendors how to get security accreditation- What is considered Protected B in the government 
* Drupal: misunderstanding about security. What is the process used within the community and the team that is maintaining it?  What is management’s approach to securing software on the internet?
  * Something for rules to work on 

## 3. Update: Working Group People

* Assessing where we are now and where we would like to be in 1 year 
* Don’t focus solely on the development skills but also the platform skills (engineering)
* Benefits to business: both using OSS and changing the culture, bring back to OneGC
* How do you maintain? Full life cycle of open source
